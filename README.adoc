== General information
Project provides sending email using two providers:
. SendGrid sendgrid.com
. Mailgun mailgun.com

If one of the services goes down it will use another provider.[Email service^]
I was using Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring Security and Swagger-UI instead of writing frontend app.
Monitoring is enabled (healthcheck), logs in app are clearly displaying what is happening in app.

== Usage
Go to page http://localhost:8080/login
credentials:

 user=user
 password=test678

It will redirect you to page http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html


== Deploy

=== Heroku

[source,bash]
-----------------
git clone https://github.com/.....
cd email-serivce
heroku  apps:create email-serivce --region eu
heroku config:set SENDGRID_API_KEY=<YOUR_MAILGUN_API_KEY>
heroku config:set MAILGUN_API_KEY=<YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY>

git push heroku master
mvn -Dheroku.appName=email-service heroku:deploy
heroku open
heloku logs --tail
-----------------

=== Scalability
You can scale up application using:
[source,bash]
-----------------
heroku ps:scale web=<NUMBER_OF_INSTANCES>
-----------------

=== On local computer
Please add two variables with your API keys to your environment:
[source,bash]
-----------------
export MAILGUN_API_KEY='<YOUR_MAILGUN_API_KEY>'
export SENDGRID_API_KEY='<YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY>'
-----------------
and run app:
[source,bash]
-----------------
mvn clean spring-boot:run
-----------------

App has versioned REST API. You can check and test it on page http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html


=== Problems

You can see following error (if API keys are not set):
"Empty API key. Please set environment params: SENDGRID_API_KEY"
"Empty API key. Please set environment params: MAILGUN_API_KEY"

You can set variables when you running app on Heroku:

[source,bash]
-----------------
heroku config:set SENDGRID_API_KEY=<YOUR_MAILGUN_API_KEY>
heroku config:set MAILGUN_API_KEY=<YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY>
-----------------
or locally:

[source,bash]
-----------------
export MAILGUN_API_KEY='<YOUR_MAILGUN_API_KEY>'
export SENDGRID_API_KEY='<YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY>'
-----------------

=== Limitations

==== Mailgun
You can send up to 300 emails/day from this sandbox server.
Next, you should add your own domain so you can send 10,000 emails/month for free.

=== SendGrid
Free accounts are limited to 12,000 emails per month.

== Monitoring

== App
http://localhost:8080/health

=== Mailgun
All logs are on page https://app.mailgun.com/app/logs

=== SendGrid
All logs are on page https://app.sendgrid.com/

== Ideas
* Test app with Gatling
* The project could consists of 3 modules:
. email-service-api - Java 8 application which uses some providers to sending email and gives REST API.
. email-service-frontend - frontend application which uses email-service-api
. commons - shared library with commons utils.
* Add profiles: prod, test, dev (they will use some other key api etc)
* Made frontend in NodeJS or Angular - I'm not the best in frontend
* Connect logging functionality with some OAuth2 using Spring Security
* Add more logic for example: if provider has some error disable him for sometime and check his health sending to some test email test message.
* Add more providers
* Add all messages from code to properties files for internationalization en/pl/..
* Use io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-prometheus to send metrics to Prometheus


== Extra
=== Building html. from .adoc
You must install http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor^] than run


[source,bash]
-----------------
asciidoctor README.adoc -o README.html
